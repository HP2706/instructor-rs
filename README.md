this is a rust port of the instructor library 

it is important to note that many features are NOT supported
this includes streaming, Async, Anthropic support, finetuning and more.

most likely streaming and Async will be supported in the future. But this depends on the evolution of the openai-api-rs crate or whether a better crate will be developed.
