This is a rust port of the instructor library. built upon the 
along with serde for serialization, schemars for json schema and validators for struct validation.

It is important to note that many features are NOT supported
this includes streaming, Async, Anthropic support, finetuning and more.

most likely streaming and Async will be supported in the future. But this depends on the evolution of the openai-api-rs crate for instance, things like streaming responses and async support are not yet implemented by the library and thus neither implemented here.
